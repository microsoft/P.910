# P.910 Crowd
The P.910-Crowd Toolkit is a software package that enables users to run subjective video quality assessment test
in a crowdsourcing platform like Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) or remote testing with a dedicated panel of workers.
It is intended to be counter part of the ITU-T Recommendation P.910 for crowdsourcing. 
 

Note: Currently full-screen play-back is not supported by HITs builds inside AMT. Therefore, we provide, the [HITAPP Server](hitapp_server/README.md)
which can serve the experiment. Consequently you can use AMT or any other crowdsourcing platform and post your study URL.
