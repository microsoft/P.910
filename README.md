# P.910 Crowd
The P.910-Crowd Toolkit is a software package that enables users to run subjective video quality assessment test
in Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) crowdsourcing platform. It is intended to be counter part of the ITU-T Recommendation P.910 
for crowdsourcing. The package can be also used in combination with [HITAPP Server](https://github.com/babaknaderi/hitapp_server)
to conduct test on any other crowdsourcing platforms.
